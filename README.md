====================
According to the requirements of the China Meteorological Administration, all users seeking to download meteorological data online must undergo real-name verification, which applies to FengYun satellite data as well. Currently, users located outside of China can only complete this process through manual review via email (iusc_nsmc@cma.gov.cn).

We now offer you the following two options for accessing FY-3G data:

1.	Send an email to iusc_nsmc@cma.gov.cn for manual review to facilitate data access.
2.	If you require a substantial amount of data for research purposes, you may submit a brief proposal to either iusc_nsmc@cma.gov.cn or lixue@cma.gov.cn, or forward it to us. Once your application is approved, the requested data will be transmitted to you via FTP.

If you experience any difficulties in accessing the data, please feel free to reach out to me (202211030001@nuist.edu.cn) or contact the following email addresses: dataserver@cma.gov.cn or iusc_nsmc@cma.gov.cn.
